\paragraph{}
In last fifty years, a number of models for realization of language transformations were introduced. Most of them can be described as an extension of a finite automaton, which has been added an output tape and the image of the transition function consists not only of states, but also of substrings of an output alphabet. Such models are e. g. Moore and Mealy machines, sequential transducers, general sequential machines, a-transducers, etc.

\paragraph{}
In our thesis, we would like to investigate some complexity properties of these transformation models, with emphasis on a-transducers. 

\paragraph{}
We assume, that the reader is acknowledged with basic concepts of formal languages. If this is not the case, we recommend to obtain this understanding from \cite{hopcroft:fola}.
