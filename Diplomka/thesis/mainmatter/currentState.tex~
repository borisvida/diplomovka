\paragraph{}
In this chapter, we would like to present some known results regarding transformation devices in general and their complexity aspects.

\section{Basic Properties of A-transducers}
\paragraph{}
This section contains few basic results from \cite{gin:AATPFL}.

\paragraph{}
\clema $\R $ and $\CF $ are closed under a-transduction.

\paragraph{}
\dokaz Let $M$ be an a-transducer and $L$ a regular (context-free) language. We use the alternative definition of image $L$:\\
\centerline{$M(L) = \{ pr_{2}(pr_{1}^{-1}(w) \cap \Pi_{M} | w \in L \}$} \\
Since $\Pi_{M}$ is regular and both classes, of regular and of context-free languages are closed under intersection with a regular language, homomorphism and inverse homomorphism (\cite{hopcroft:fola}), they are also closed under a-transduction. \square

\paragraph{}
\cdosledok Since sequential transducers and generalized sequential machines are just generalizations of an a-transducer, this lemma also holds for these devices.

\paragraph{}
In previous chapter, we have defined a special class of 1-bounded a-transducers. Following theorem shows, that this limitation forms a normal form.

\paragraph{}
\clema Let $M_{1}$ be an arbitrary a-transducer. Then there exists a 1-bounded a-transducer $M_{2}$, such that $\forall L: M_{1}(L) = M_{2}(L)$.

\paragraph{}
\dokaz Let $(q, u, v, p) \in H_{1}, u \equiv a_{1}a_{2}...a_{m}, v \equiv b_{1}b_{2}...b_{n}$. Let $m\geq n$ (for $m < n$ the proof is very similar). $M_{2}$ will have states $q, q_{a_{1}}, q_{a_{2}}, ..., q_{a_{n-1}}, q_{a_{n}} \equiv p$ and transitions in form $(q_{a_{i}}, a_{i+1}, b_{i+1}, a_{a_{i+1}})$ for $1 \leq i<n$, resp. $(q_{a_{j}}, a_{j+1}, \epsilon, a_{a_{j+1}})$ for $n < j < m$. This will be done for every $h \in H$. It is easy to see, that the a-transduction by $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ is the same and therefore $\forall L: M_{1}(L) = M_{2}(L)$. \square

\paragraph{}
As one can see, this construction can increase the number of states of an a-transducer by a constant multiple. Sometimes it is more convenient to consider only 1-bounded a-transducer, since its complexity can be easier compared with other computational models.

\paragraph{}
In the next section, we quote results regarding the question, when it is possible to transform one language to another using an a-transducer. The next theorem gives us another view of this problem using the theory of language families.

\paragraph{}
\clema For every two ($\epsilon $-free a-transducers $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ there exists an ($\epsilon $-free) a-transducer $M_{3}$ such that $\forall L: M_{3}(L) = M_{2}(M_{1}(L))$.

\paragraph{}
\dokaz We show just the idea of the proof: We may assume that $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are 1-bounded. $M_{3}$ simulates both of the a-transducers concurrently (so its internal state have the form $(q \times p)$), reads the input according to transition function of $M_{1}$ and writes the corresponding output of $M_{2}$, while the output of $M_{1}$ forms the input of $M_{2}$. It is easy to see, that $\forall L: M_{3}(L) = M_{2}(M_{1}(L))$. \square

\paragraph{}
\clema For every ($\epsilon $-free) homomorphism $h: \Sigma_{1}^{*} \rightarrow \Sigma_{2}^{*}$ there is an ($\epsilon $-free) a-transducer $M$, such that $\forall L: M(L) = h(L)$.

\paragraph{}
\dokaz The a-transducer $M=(K, \Sigma_{1}, \Sigma_{2}, H, q_{0}, F)$ will look as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $K = F = \{ q \}$,
\item $q_{0} = q$,
\item $H = \{ (q, a, h(a), q) | a \in \Sigma_{1} \}$. \square
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
\clema For every homomorphism $h$ there is an a-transducer $M$, such that $\forall L: M(L) = h^{-1}(L)$.

\paragraph{}
\dokaz As in previous Lemma, except $H = \{ (q, h(a), a, q) | a \in \Sigma_{1} \}$. \square

\paragraph{}
\clema For every $R \in \R $, there exists an $\epsilon $-free a-transducer $M$, such that $M(L) = L \cap R$.

\paragraph{}
\dokaz Let $A = (K, \Sigma, q_{0}, \delta, F)$ be a nondeterministic finite automaton, such that $L(A) = R$. Then $M=(K, \Sigma, \Sigma, H, q_{0}, F)$, where $H=\{ (q, a, a, \delta (q,a)) | q \in K, a \in \Sigma \} $. \square

\paragraph{}
\oznacenie For each family $\mathcal{L} $ of languages, \\
\centerline{$\mathcal{M(L)} = \{ M(L) | L \in \mathcal{L}, M$ is an $\epsilon $-free a-transducer$\} $} \\
\centerline{$\mathcal{\hat{M}(L)} = \{ M(L) | L \in \mathcal{L}, M$ is an arbitrary a-transducer$\} $}

\paragraph{}
\cveta For each family $\mathcal{L} $ of languages, $\mathcal{M(L)} $ $(\mathcal{\hat{M}(L)}) $ is the smallest (full) trio containing $\mathcal{L} $.

\paragraph{}
\dokaz Once again, we use the alternative definition of image of $L$, $M(L) = \{ pr_{2}(pr_{1}^{-1}(w) \cap \Pi_{M} | w \in L \}$. Considering previous lemmas, $\mathcal{M(L)} $ $(\mathcal{\hat{M}(L)}) $ is clearly a (full) trio (note, that if $M$ is $\epsilon $-free, $pr_{2}$ is also $\epsilon $-free).

\paragraph{}
Now, let $\mathcal{L'} $ be a (full) trio containing $\mathcal{L} $. Obviously, $\mathcal{L'} $ also contains $\mathcal{M(L)} $ $(\mathcal{\hat{M}(L)}) $, since it has to be closed under ($\epsilon $-free) homomorphism, inverse homomorphism and intersection with a regular language. Therefore, $\mathcal{M(L)} $ $(\mathcal{\hat{M}(L)}) $ is the smallest (full) trio containing $\mathcal{L} $. \square

\paragraph{}
\oznacenie If $\mathcal{L}$ is a single language, we write $\mathcal{M}(L)$ instead of $\mathcal{M}(\{ L\} )$.

\paragraph{}
In fact, it was shown in \cite{gingrei:pAFL}, that $\mathcal{M(L)} $ $(\mathcal{\hat{M}(L)}) $ is the smallest (full) semi-AFL containing language L.

\section{Existence of an A-transducer for a Pair of Languages}studena vojna
\paragraph{}
Here we present few results regarding the question, when it is possible to transform a language $L_{1}$ to a language $L_{2}$.

\subsection{Regular Languages}
\paragraph{}
The answer to aforementioned question, when dealing with regular languages, is very simple.

\paragraph{}
\cveta For every regular language $R$ and arbitrary language $L$ there exists an a-transducer $M$, such that $M(L) = R$.

\paragraph{}
\dokaz Let $A = (K, \Sigma, q_{0}, \delta, F)$ be a nondeterministic finite automaton, such that $L(A) = R$. Then $M=(K, \Sigma_{1}, \Sigma, H, q_{0}, F)$, where $H=\{ (q, \epsilon , a, \delta (q,a)) | q \in K, a \in \Sigma \} \cap \{ (q_{0}, a, \epsilon, q_{0}) | a \in \Sigma_{1} \} $. \square

\subsection{Context-free Languages}
\paragraph{}
Contrary to the case of regular languages, it has showed itself, that the task to determine for two context-free lagnuages $U$ and $V$, if $U \in \mathcal{M}(V)$, is not trivial to solve at all. Actually, it is quite easy to show, that $U \in \mathcal{M}(V)$, but to prove the revers, i. e. $U \notin \mathcal{M}(V)$, is relatively difficult. For this reason, it is convenient to consider only a special subclass of $\CF $, called bounded languages.

\paragraph{}
\definicia A language is called \emph{bounded}, if $L \subseteq w_{1}w_{2}...w_{n}$ for some words $w_{1}, w_{2}, ..., w_{n}$.

\paragraph{}
Moreover, we consider only bounded languages, where $\forall i, j, 1 \leq i,j \leq n: |w_{i}| = 1 \wedge w_{i} \neq w_{j}$. 

\paragraph{}
Following theorems show some necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of an a-transduction between languages $U$ and $V$. These results were achieved with extensive use of the AFL theory, which is motivated by the first lemma. Major part of these results are not accompanied with a proof, since they are listed only for illustration of properties of a-transducers and do not form the main aim of our thesis.

\oznacenie Let $n \geq 2$ and $f_{i}$ be a strictly increasing function (i. e. $x_{1} < x_{2} \Rightarrow f_{i}(x_{1}) < f_{i}(x_{2})$) from $\mathbb{N} $ to $\mathbb{N} $ for all $ 1 \leq i \leq n$. By \\
\centerline{$\langle a_{1}^{f_{1}(x)}...a_{n}^{f_{n}(x)} \rangle $} \\
we denote the set $\{ a_{1}^{f_{1}(x)}...a_{n}^{f_{n}(x)} | x \in \mathbb{N} \} $.

\paragraph{}
\oznacenie By $\mathcal{F}(L) $ $(\hat{\mathcal{F}} (L) )$ we denote the smallest (full) AFL containing $L$.

\paragraph{}
\clema Let $L_{1} = \langle b_{1}^{g_{1}(x)}...b_{n}^{g_{n}(x)} \rangle $ and $L_{2}$ be a nonempty language. $L_{1} \in \mathcal{F}(L) \Leftrightarrow L_{1} \in \mathcal{M}(L)$ and $L_{1} \in \hat{\mathcal{F}}(L) \Leftrightarrow L_{1} \in \hat{\mathcal{M}}(L)$.

\paragraph{}
\oznacenie By $\psi_{\langle a_{1},...,a_{n}\rangle }$ we denote a mapping from $a_{1}^{*}...a_{n}^{*}$ into $\mathbb{N}^{n}$ defined as follows: \\
\centerline{$\psi_{\langle a_{1},...,a_{n}\rangle (w) } = (\# _{a_{1}}(w), ..., \# _{a_{n}(w)}) $.}
