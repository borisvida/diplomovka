Nazov: Using Transformation in Solving Problems with Supplementary Information

Zadanie: The aim of the thesis is to propose a suitable framework for investigating the use of transformation in solving problems with supplementary information. Furthermore, the goal is to study the complexity properties, and compare these results to those achieved for supplementary information without the use of transformation.
