We claim, that at least one of the words $v_j$ for $p < j < 2p$ belongs to $L_{adv}$. If this was not the case, each of $v_j$ would yield another equivalence class, since $v_j.(x^{2p-j}) \in L_{adv} \wedge \forall k, k < j: v_k.(x^{2p-j}) \notin L_{adv}$ (the witness strings can be easily constructed from this argument). Together with $v_p$, which belongs to $L_{adv}$, the number of equivalence classes is greater or equal to $p$. Now, let $m$ be the smallest number, such that $p < m < 2p \wedge v_m \notin L_{adv}$.
