\paragraph{}
A number of models for realization of language transformations were introduced in the past fifty years. Most of them can be described as an extension of a finite automaton, which has been augmented by an output tape. Such models are, e. g., Moore and Mealy machines, sequential transducers, general sequential machines, a-transducers, etc.

\paragraph{}
In our thesis, we would like to investigate some complexity properties of these transformation models, with emphasis on a-transducers. 

\paragraph{}
We assume, that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of formal languages. If this is not the case, we recommend to obtain this understanding from \cite{hopcroft:fola}.
